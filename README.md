*A simple program to help English speakers learn numbers 0-100 in German*<br />

This program uses srand() to randomize numbers 0-100 and keeps count of how many correct translations the user makes<br />
  The ÃŸ (eszett) should be input by the user as 'ss'<br />
  The user should also ignore any umlauts<br />
